### Using the code shared in Jupyter notebook "Building a Neural Network from Scratch", please complete the following:

- Implement the sigmoid and relu activation functions

- Implement a function to evaluate model performance, i.e., when trained model performs predictions on a test/validation dataset; your evaluate function should calculate metric like accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and print/display them.

- Using the above functions and neural network model, find a dataset on Kaggle; prepare it (columns, target labels, etc), normalize data so that it can be used in neural network, train the model and test with validation portion of dataset. Using evaluate function you implemented, show the model's performance

- Open a private repo on github.com and push your saved notebook (showing the results) and dataset to that repo. Please add me as the contributor of that repo (murseltasginBoun)

- **PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE IPYNB AND USE VS CODE OR COLLAB TO VIEW THE FILE PROPERLY**
